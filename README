README for Search::FreeText

A Perl implementation of free text searching and indexing for
medium-to-large text corpuses.  Based on the BM25 weighting scheme
described in Robertson, S. E., Walker, S., Beaulieu, M. M., Gatford,
M., and Payne, A. (1995). Okapi at TREC-4, in NIST Special Publication
500-236, the Fourth Text Retrieval Conference (TREC-4), pages 73-96.

This module is generic: it allows a user-specified document key,
which either be a filename, a URL, or a database record, to be 
attached to each individual file. 


SYNOPSIS

my $text = new Search::FreeText(-db => ['DB_File', "stories.db"]);

$text->open_index();
$text->clear_index();
$text->index_document(1, "Hello world");
$text->index_document(2, "World in motion");
$text->index_document(3, "Cruel crazy beautiful world");
$text->index_document(4, "Hey crazy");
$text->close_index();

... go away and do something else ...

$text->open_index();
foreach ($text->search("Crazy", 10)) {
    print "$_->[0], $_->[1]\n";
};
$text->close_index();

TO DO

*  Other indexing systems besides BM25, e.g., LSA, vector-space. 
*  Allow people to remove documents as well as index them
*  Make locking for indexing something to handle in this module 
   instead of users responsibility
*  And many many more
